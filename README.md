WARNING
-------

This is super-experimental stuff that is just being pushed off
my volatile laptop into the warm embrace of the cloud. :)


Problem
-------

[Dungeons of Dredmor](https://dungeonsofdredmor.com/) is a roguelike game
with lots of discoverable content.

If you'd like to learn more about items, monsters, or spells, you can try
to read the [player-maintained wiki](http://dungeonsofdredmor.wikia.com/wiki/Dungeons_of_Dredmor_Wiki).

Or you can build a tool that parses the XML game files directly
and is always up-to-date.

Technology
----------

This is a proof-of-concept app, written with Om/Next and Datascript,
with a DevCards development workflow.

Setup
-----

```
$ boot dev
```

App:

Inspiration
-----------

The code is written from scratch, as an exercise.

The idea for the app is not mine. It is solely the result of previously published work:
